Seed=2 Prompt: ""
Druids have been known to marry dragons, and royal couples appear to have some type of secret wedding ritual to symbolize the kingdom they represent. The most famous, certainly, is that of Prince Samator, a dragon that turns out to be true kin to the sorceress Skaven. You've seen King Troy on the list, right? They all apparently got together.

As far as their people go, Kings and Ladies are supposed to marry the dragon, as a sign that they have a secret marriage promise.
>>> Most of them

Ok, so why not choose a magical god instead of a dragon or something?
>>> 
Well, one last thing before they do it.
