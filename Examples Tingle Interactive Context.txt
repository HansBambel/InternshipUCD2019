The rocket man is a level and four magical beast in the King's Decks district of The Guild.

He wears a long black robe with a white border, and a golden cross hanging down at the brim, on which white lightning is flash bright within.

Like me, he appears to be a very old man, about sixty years old with a shaggy green robe over his body, and a broad brimmed helm that extends from head to toe.
"A wizard?"
>>> 
I ask.
>>> 
The old wizard cracks an imposing smile.
>>> "Yes!"
I nod solemnly.
>>> 
"Yes, sir.
>>> 
Bark for the wizard himself, there are many spellcasters across the northern states, many of them have dead parents as well.
>>> "
Bark for the wizard!
>>> 
One last thing."
>>> 
The old wizard turns around and collects himself as he walks, then stops abruptly when he sees me.
>>> 
His eyes light up.
>>> 
"Go!"
>>> 
I shout.
>>> 
"Back to the Magical Websites!"
>>> 
The wizard turns and heads back towards his bedroom, which is much more expensive than I had anticipated.
>>> 
"What do you think?"
>>> 
I question.
>>> 
"Is it time to go?"
>>> 
"Back to the Magical Websites!"
>>> 
The wizard retorts.
>>> 
"Go?"
>>> 
I think back to the last sentence and then answer emphatically.
>>> 
"Yes."
>>> 
The magical beasts all round me burst out laughing.
>>> 
"Go!"
>>> 
they cry.
>>> 
"Long journey, that's all."
>>> 
I pause for a moment.
>>> 
"Then what happened?"
>>> 
"Long gone?"
>>> 
The old manops demon asks.
>>> 
"Are you sure you want to meet me?"
>>> 
I nod.
>>> 
"Meet face to face."
>>> 
The wizard smiles.
>>> 
"Would you like to meet me?"
>>> 
"Not yet."
>>> 
I tell him.
>>> 
The wizard and me exchange glances.
>>> 
"So meet?"
>>> 
I freeze suddenly.
>>> 
"Meet?"
>>> 
The old manops demon shakes his head.
>>> 
"Not yet.
>>> 
It takes quite a bit of patience to get here, but I've only got half of the puzzle to fall back on."
>>> His robe
comes off in a bright red glow and I recognize it immediately.
>>> 
"And besides, I've only got half the puzzle to fall back on, that's all there is to go around."
>>> 
My heart breaks.
>>> 
"Why did you disappear?"
>>> 
I ask.
>>> 
The old manops demon tries to explain.
>>> 
"I don't know."
>>> 
"Maybe you should try to stop me."
>>> 
I counter.
>>> 
The old manops demon starts slowly, closing his eyes as he considers my words.
>>> 
"Of course I am wrong."
>>> 
The old manops demon says.
>>> 
"I'm a demon, and this is all part of the journey home."
>>> 
"But why?"
>>> 
I question.
>>> 
The old manops demon looks back to me.
>>> 
"Because I wanted to leave behind my father, who was both a wizard and a mage, and it's very clear that this journey to this magical place is not just about me.

I had the pleasure of Billings Unilever's Birthday present last night and I am so happy for these powerful unicorns! They remind me of my great-aunt and I, they remind me of everything that I's treasured most as a Brit, yet they also remind me of what a great lover they're trying to be, a horned unicorn and a horned American! They're such a powerful weapon and, dare I say, enchanting.
The two of them fight and both horned men eventually drawing their swords, Ripper and Butt.
